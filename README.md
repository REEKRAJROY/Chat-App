# Fullstack chatting application  with User Authentication using Chat Engine

This is a chatting application built using Reactjs. @ant-design, axios and react-chat-engine were some of the dependencies that were used. User can create multiple chat rooms, get sound notification, send text, images, emojis, add users, change admin and a lot more. The backend has been made using [chat engine](https://chatengine.io/) which provides user and admin privileges <br><br>
The project has been built following this [Video](https://youtu.be/jcOKU9f86XE) from JavaScript Mastery YouTube channel. <br><br>
